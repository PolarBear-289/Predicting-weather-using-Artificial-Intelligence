# Predicting-weather-using-Artificial-Intelligence
<h1>Introduction</h1>
Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a given location.  Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere  and  using  scientific  understanding  of  atmospheric  processes  to  project  how  the  atmosphere  will evolve
This Model is build using Artificial Neural Networks.
<ul><h2>Key software used:</h2>

</t><li>Python<br></li>
</t><li>Scikit learn<br></li>

<h1> Features</h2>
Due to the advancement of modern computer hardware there have been many improvements in numerical weather prediction . We are using ANN which is based on smart analyzing the trend from historical data.
The other models are accurate in calculation but not in predictions the can not able to adapt the irregular patterns of data which can neither be written in form of function or deducted as formula.
Use of ANN will give more accurate result. Here, the error may or may not reduce completely. But, the accuracy will improve as compared to other forecasts.

<h2>Accuracy</h2>
89%
